# Module Descriptions #

## RAM Module ##
Also called as the Data Memory, used for storing Data Structures <br/> like stacks, spilled registers, Function
call arguments and Return <br/>addresses in the RISC V Architecture
| Signal | Description |
|:--:|-----|
|cs|chip select line (Interleaved Type Memory org). Generated by the MMU. Enables one or more modules for read/write out of the 4 available Memory modules |
|Addr|30 bit address bus Generated by the MMU points towards the  memory location to read/write|
|data_i| 8 bit input data used for write operation|
|data_o| 8 bit output data used for read operation| 
|re|read enable - Control signal <br/>|
|we|write enable - Control signal|
|clk|clock signal - Positive edge triggered module|
### Operational Modes ###
|cs|re|we|Mode of operation|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|1|0|Read operation<br/>8 bit data from the address pointed by the Addr signal is fetched and placd in data_o|
|1|0|1|Write operation<br/>8 bit data from data_i is written in the address pointed by the Addr signals
|1|1|1| *According to module definition Read Operation happens|
|0|x|x| No Operation|
<br/>

## Decoder Module ##
Decodes the instruction stored in the instruction register after the fetch operation. Functionalities include - identifying the instruction type (R,I etc) ,separating the opcodes and functional code from the register and decoding the addresses bits for different memory units such as the Register and the RAM module. 

| Signal | Description |
|:--:|-----|
|IR|Instruction register.The instruction fetched during the fetch cycle is stored in this 32-bit register|
|DecoderEnable|Enables the functioning of the decode Asserted/Deasserted by the control unit|
|opcode|Forms the first 7 bits of any instruction. Determines the type of instruction and how the other bit-fields are organised in the IR|
|funct3|3-bit functional code |
|funct7|7-bit functional code|
|src1|Address of the first source register decoded from the instruction|
|src2|Address of the second source register decoded from the instruction|
|dest|Address of the destination register decoded from the instruction|
|imm|12-bit data present in the instruction itself,ordering of the bits is determined by the opcode|
|clk|clock signal - positive edge triggered module|
