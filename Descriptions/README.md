# Module Descriptions #

## RAM Module ##
Also called as the Data Memory, used for storing Data Structures <br/> like stacks, spilled registers, Function
call arguments and Return <br/>addresses in the RISC V Architecture
| Signal | Description |
|:--:|-----|
|cs|chip select line (Interleaved Type Memory org). Generated by the MMU. Enables one or more modules for read/write out of the 4 available Memory modules |
|Addr|30 bit address bus Generated by the MMU points towards the  memory location to read/write|
|data_i| 8 bit input data used for write operation|
|data_o| 8 bit output data used for read operation| 
|re|read enable - Control signal <br/>|
|we|write enable - Control signal|
|clk|clock signal - Positive edge triggered module|
### Operational Modes ###
|cs|re|we|Mode of operation|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|1|0|Read operation<br/>8 bit data from the address pointed by the Addr signal is fetched and placd in data_o|
|1|0|1|Write operation<br/>8 bit data from data_i is written in the address pointed by the Addr signals
|1|1|1| *According to module definition Read Operation happens|
|0|x|x| No Operation|
